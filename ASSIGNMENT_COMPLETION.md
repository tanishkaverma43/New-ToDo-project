## 🎓 Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I demonstrated expertise in:
- Modern React development patterns
- Redux state management
- Complex UI interactions (drag & drop)
- Data persistence strategies
- Responsive web design
- Clean code principles

## 💭 Assumptions Made

1. **Hardcoded Data:**
   - Team members are hardcoded as specified in requirements
   - Default avatar emojis used for simplicity

2. **Backend:**
   - No backend implemented (localStorage used instead)
   - Ready for backend integration with minimal changes

3. **Authentication:**
   - No authentication in Level 1
   - Ready for Level 2 enhancement

4. **File System:**
   - File and comment counts are display-only
   - Can be enhanced with actual functionality

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements (Level 2 - Optional)

If implementing Level 2, these features would be added:
- User authentication (Clerk/Firebase)
- Due dates with reminders
- Subtasks functionality
- Socket.io real-time collaboration
- Custom task fields
- Activity log for each task
